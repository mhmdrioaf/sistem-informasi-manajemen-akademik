# Product Distribution Information System (_Sistem Informasi Distribusi Product_)

This project was created with the ReactJS Framework and Firebase for the authorization and/or authentication systems.
The purpose of this project was to fulfill my theses project and was made for the SMK Korporasi Garut to make it easier for students and/or teachers to market the products they have produced.
  
## Application Features
### Marketplace  
#### Descriptions
In the marketplace, sellers (students and teachers) could post their products to market them to the system. Sellers could also see their list of products that have been posted and could edit the posts. Marketplace is accessible by every user role even if the user has not signed up yet (guest user). But only registered users can place orders for the products.
In the marketplace, sellers will have their own store pages. The store page was used for sharing their seller identity, such as what products they've produced and many more.  
#### Payment Methods
The payment method for the marketplace is going to be using GoPay payment methods and/or bank transfer payment methods. But if the stakeholder is willing to provide the requirements for creating a QRIS account, then the payment method is going to be using QRIS.
